# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    - I feel very confident with comparison operators. I'm clear on the difference between assignment, loosely equal, and strictly equal. And I was already familiar with using bang (!) for not. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    - Once again, very confident. I was already familiar with and have used and (&&) and or (||) as well as bang (!), which we covered in comparisons but not yet in logical operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    - I feel very comfortable with if statements. I've used them in both JS and Python before. The concepts are the same, but the syntax is a little different (like 'elif' in Python instead of 'else if' in JS).
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    - I think I spent about an hour or so getting through the whole bit, including answering these questions. That felt about right for me. Maybe it was a little longer because I always feel weird dealing with the videos. So, maybe more like 1.5 hrs.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - Right now, we're still in territory that I'm familiar with, so I don't know if I'll need to do any extra practice yet. But, if I come across something in the other assignments that I'm not so familiar with, I'll utilize empty space on my calendar (because there's still some for now!) to practice.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - No questions at the moment! Stay tuned with subsequent assignments! :)
